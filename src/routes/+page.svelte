				The Problem with Traditional Job Portals
			</h2>
			<p class="mb-8 font-light text-gray-500 sm:text-xl dark:text-gray-400">
				Many job seekers struggle to find the right opportunities due to the inherent limitations of
				traditional job portals. These platforms often feature expired or inactive job posts,
				leading to wasted time and resentment. Basic keyword matching and lack of personalized
				recommendations mean users frequently receive irrelevant job suggestions. Additionally, the
				user experience on these sites can be cumbersome, with complex interfaces and inefficient
				search functions making navigation difficult. Perhaps most concerning is the prevalence of
				fake job listings, which can mislead job seekers and waste valuable time. Infrequent updates
				further exacerbate these issues, resulting in missed opportunities as new job postings are
				not added promptly.
